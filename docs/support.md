**[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mvvmcross)**

Use StackOverflow to find already asked questions, and post new questions with details about your problem. Do add tags to at least MvvmCross and Xamarin to be able to find it.

** [Slack](https://xamarinchat.herokuapp.com/) - join the mvvmcross room **

Use Slack to get in touch with us, and ask quick questions. After joining the Xamarin Chat, add the MvvmCross channel to find all other MvvmCross users.

** [Xamarin forums](http://forums.xamarin.com) **

Use the Xamarin forums for specific questions where neither StackOverflow or Slack works for you.
